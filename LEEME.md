# Data Engineer - Challenge
For this challenge I decide to use Python for the code and a SQL Server for the data load.

## Python Code
The code python code get the csv files from the challenge repository (https://github.com/walmartdigital/de-challenge/tree/main/data), transform the data the load the tables in the database.
Once loaded the data in the database, the code read the data and shows the information with the best and worst games as requested.
The python code is in the folder Python/ in the root

## Databse
The database used is a Microsoft SQL Server.
Inside the database four tables are created according to the data model.

## Data Model
For the data model, I choose to use "Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler" tool, for the nexts reason.
- Easy to use tool, with the necesary caracteristics to model this data model
- Free tool
- Can generate SQL scripts with the tables definitions for SQL Server Database

## Deployment 
The deploy instructions are in the Deployment.md file in the Deployment folder.
